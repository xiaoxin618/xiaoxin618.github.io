I choose this major because I am very interested in computer major,it represents high technology and high salary in my mind. In this new environment, I am most looking forward to learning professional knowledge about computer that I have never touched before, such as programming code and so on. However, my English is very poor, and our major attaches great importance to English, which also makes me feel a lot of pressure, but I will try my best.


Thinking about success
======
In my childhood, influenced by TV dramas and people around me, I thought success was getting into a good university, finding a good job, and then marrying into a good family. Later, as I get older, I understand more and more that I now think that doing what I think is right and working for it is success. I think success and happiness are different. Success is only one way to achieve happ
iness, and there are many ways to feel happiness. In my life, I have been greatly influenced by my mother, who takes her work seriously and gives her best in everything she does. Influenced by her, I will be strict with myself in study.

Thinking of values
------
The purpose of studying this course is not only to gain credits, but more importantly to improve self-awareness and explore knowledge and skills. When it comes to my personal values, the first is honesty and integrity. I believe that only by treating others sincerely can we win the respect and trust of others. In addition, I also attach great importance to responsibility and diligence. In my opinion, whether in work or in life, we all need to take our responsibilities and work hard to achieve our goals. I admire people who are tolerant of others and respect different views and differences. I also aspire to be a person who knows how to respect others, is not arrogant, and keeps learning and growing with humility. I think perseverance, optimism and good communication are the necessary conditions to express oneself successfully. These qualities enable me to remain resilient in the face of challenges and difficulties and actively seek solutions. At the same time, an optimistic attitude allows me to maintain a positive attitude and better cope with various situations in life.
